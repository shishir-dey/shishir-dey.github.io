- Apple Thunderbolt: A high-speed input/output (I/O) technology that allows for fast data transfer rates and the ability to daisy-chain multiple devices.

- CAN: Controller Area Network is a bus system used in vehicles and industrial automation for communications among microcontrollers and devices.

- Ethernet: A wired networking technology that uses cables to connect devices together to share resources and communicate with each other.

- HDMI: High-Definition Multimedia Interface is a digital interface for transmitting audio and video signals between devices.

- I2C: Inter-Integrated Circuit is a serial communication protocol used to connect low-speed peripherals and devices to a microcontroller or CPU.

- I2S: Inter-IC Sound is a serial communication protocol used for digital audio data transfer between devices.

- I3C: I3C is a new interface developed by MIPI Alliance that offers higher data transfer rates, lower power consumption, and backward compatibility with I2C. It also supports SPI devices and includes new features for easier device management.

- Infrared: A wireless communication technology that uses infrared light to transmit data between devices.

- MIPI Camera Serial Interface (CSI): A protocol used to connect cameras to processors in mobile devices.

- MIPI Display Serial Interface (DSI): A protocol used to connect displays to processors in mobile devices.

- NVM Express: A protocol used for high-speed communication between solid-state drives (SSDs) and a computer's CPU.
