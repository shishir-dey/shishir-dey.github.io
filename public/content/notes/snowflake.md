I never mind picking up new titles. Mr. Universe, Mr. Olympia, Terminator, Governor. If you want to call me snowflake, that's fine - it would have made an excellent Mr. Freeze line. But let me give you some advice. If you are going to call somebody a snowflake because they believe in a different policy than you, you might want to look in the mirror. When you see an idea you disagree with, you can get angry, or you can learn. Id recommend you research and learn and grow. You can still disagree - That's the best part about being American. But at least you can disagree with evidence and analysis. We can all be better if we simply don't react. Pause, reflect, learn and then decide if you want to call somebody a snowflake. Good luck with everything.
